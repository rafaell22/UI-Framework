# UI-Framework
Framework based on VUE.js. Made to be light to use when developing using a mobile device.

This is a "rough" framework I developed to build front-end applications. It follows a few constraints and ideas:
- **I wanted to learn more about front-end Javascript frameworks:** I was curious how other JavaScript front-end frameworks work and if I would be able to accomplish some of their features. This means that this is highly experimental and not necessarily the most efficient/optimized/best framework available. This also means that it is not recommended for production applications (it has not been exhaustedly tested and validated);
- **Build a custom solution that catered to my needs:** Most of my experience in popular UI frameworks comes from VUE.js. One of my main issues with it is trying to figure out how to do certain things "the VUE" way. I wanted to have a framework that I could "completely" understand and change/update as necessary;
- **Light weight to develop with:** I wanted to create a framework that would be simple/fast to develop with when I only have access to my phone. There are not many "great" development environments available for Android phones, so I needed something that did not have "tons" of dependencies, that would take a lot of space or take a long time to build/compile. I tried to use VUE.js with Termux + Node.js, but there are many dependencies/packages that simply don't work there. I chose to use UI-Framework + Termux + Node.js.
